   * Returns a ResolveContext that includes a portion of this one
   *
   * Given a state, this method creates a new ResolveContext from this one.
   * The new context starts at the first node (root) and stops at the node for the `state` parameter.
   *
   * #### Why
   *
   * When a transition is created, the nodes in the "To Path" are injected from a ResolveContext.
   * A ResolveContext closes over a path of [[PathNode]]s and processes the resolvables.
   * The "To State" can inject values from its own resolvables, as well as those from all its ancestor state's (node's).
   * This method is used to create a narrower context when injecting ancestor nodes.
   *
   * @example
   * `let ABCD = new ResolveContext([A, B, C, D]);`
   *
   * Given a path `[A, B, C, D]`, where `A`, `B`, `C` and `D` are nodes for states `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`:
   * When injecting `D`, `D` should have access to all resolvables from `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`.
   * However, `B` should only be able to access resolvables from `A`, `B`.
   *
   * When resolving for the `B` node, first take the full "To Path" Context `[A,B,C,D]` and limit to the subpath `[A,B]`.
   * `let AB = ABCD.subcontext(a)`

   *
   * This adds a [[Resolvable]] (generally one created on the fly; not declared on a [[StateDeclaration.resolve]] block).
   * The resolvable is added to the node matching the `state` parameter.
   *
   * These new resolvables are not automatically fetched.
   * The calling code should either fetch them, fetch something that depends on them,
   * or rely on [[resolvePath]] being called when some state is being entered.
   *
   * Note: each resolvable's [[ResolvePolicy]] is merged with the state's policy, and the global default.
