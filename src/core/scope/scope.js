/**
 * DESIGN NOTES
 *
 * The design decisions behind the scope are heavily favored for speed and memory consumption.
 *
 * The typical use of scope is to watch the expressions, which most of the time return the same
 * value as last time so we optimize the operation.
 *
 * Closures construction is expensive in terms of speed as well as memory:
 *   - No closures, instead use prototypical inheritance for API
 *   - Internal state needs to be stored on scope directly, which means that private state is
 *     exposed as $$____ properties
 *
 * Loop operations are optimized by using while(count--) { ... }
 *   - This means that in order to keep the same order of execution as addition we have to add
 *     items to the array at the beginning (unshift) instead of at the end (push)
 *
 * Child scopes are created and removed often
 *   - Using an array would be slow since inserts in the middle are expensive; so we use linked lists
 *
 * There are fewer watches than observers. This is why you don't want the observer to be implemented
 * in the same way as watch. Watch requires return of the initialization function which is expensive
 * to construct.

  /**
 * Registers a `listener` callback to be executed whenever the `watchExpression` changes.
 *
 * - The `watchExpression` is called on every call to {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest
 *   $digest()} and should return the value that will be watched. (`watchExpression` should not change
 *   its value when executed multiple times with the same input because it may be executed multiple
 *   times by {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest()}. That is, `watchExpression` should be
 *   [idempotent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence).)
 * - The `listener` is called only when the value from the current `watchExpression` and the
 *   previous call to `watchExpression` are not equal (with the exception of the initial run,
 *   see below). Inequality is determined according to reference inequality,
 *   [strict comparison](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators)
 *    via the `!==` Javascript operator, unless `objectEquality == true`
 *   (see next point)
 * - When `objectEquality == true`, inequality of the `watchExpression` is determined
 *   according to the {@link angular.equals} function. To save the value of the object for
 *   later comparison, the {@link structuredClone} function is used. This therefore means that
 *   watching complex objects will have adverse memory and performance implications.
 * - This should not be used to watch for changes in objects that are (or contain)
 *   [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/File) objects due to limitations with {@link structuredClone `structuredClone`}.
 * - The watch `listener` may change the model, which may trigger other `listener`s to fire.
 *   This is achieved by rerunning the watchers until no changes are detected. The rerun
 *   iteration limit is 10 to prevent an infinite loop deadlock.
 *
 *
 * If you want to be notified whenever {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} is called,
 * you can register a `watchExpression` function with no `listener`. (Be prepared for
 * multiple calls to your `watchExpression` because it will execute multiple times in a
 * single {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} cycle if a change is detected.)
 *
 * After a watcher is registered with the scope, the `listener` fn is called asynchronously
 * (via {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$evalAsync $evalAsync}) to initialize the
 * watcher. In rare cases, this is undesirable because the listener is called when the result
 * of `watchExpression` didn't change. To detect this scenario within the `listener` fn, you
 * can compare the `newVal` and `oldVal`. If these two values are identical (`===`) then the
 * listener was called due to initialization.
 *
 *
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
     // let's assume that scope was dependency injected as the $rootScope
     let scope = $rootScope;
     scope.name = 'misko';
     scope.counter = 0;

     expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);
     scope.$watch('name', function(newValue, oldValue) {
       scope.counter = scope.counter + 1;
     });
     expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);

     scope.$digest();
     // the listener is always called during the first $digest loop after it was registered
     expect(scope.counter).toEqual(1);

     scope.$digest();
     // but now it will not be called unless the value changes
     expect(scope.counter).toEqual(1);

     scope.name = 'adam';
     scope.$digest();
     expect(scope.counter).toEqual(2);

     // Using a function as a watchExpression
     let food;
     scope.foodCounter = 0;
     expect(scope.foodCounter).toEqual(0);
     scope.$watch(
       // This function returns the value being watched. It is called for each turn of the $digest loop
       function() { return food; },
       // This is the change listener, called when the value returned from the above function changes
       function(newValue, oldValue) {
         if ( newValue !== oldValue ) {
           // Only increment the counter if the value changed
           scope.foodCounter = scope.foodCounter + 1;
         }
       }
     );
     // No digest has been run so the counter will be zero
     expect(scope.foodCounter).toEqual(0);

     // Run the digest but since food has not changed count will still be zero
     scope.$digest();
     expect(scope.foodCounter).toEqual(0);

     // Update food and run digest.  Now the counter will increment

  /**
 * Processes all of the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watchers} of the current scope and
 * its children. Because a {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watcher}'s listener can change
 * the model, the `$digest()` keeps calling the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watchers}
 * until no more listeners are firing. This means that it is possible to get into an infinite
 * loop. This function will throw `'Maximum iteration limit exceeded.'` if the number of
 * iterations exceeds 10.
 *
 * Usually, you don't call `$digest()` directly in
 * {@link ng.directive:ngController controllers} or in
 * {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directives}.
 * Instead, you should call {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply $apply()} (typically from within
 * a {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directive}), which will force a `$digest()`.
 *
 * If you want to be notified whenever `$digest()` is called,
 * you can register a `watchExpression` function with
 * {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch $watch()} with no `listener`.
 *
 * In unit tests, you may need to call `$digest()` to simulate the scope life cycle.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
     let scope = ...;
     scope.name = 'misko';
     scope.counter = 0;

     expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);
     scope.$watch('name', function(newValue, oldValue) {
       scope.counter = scope.counter + 1;
     });
     expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);

     scope.$digest();
     // the listener is always called during the first $digest loop after it was registered
     expect(scope.counter).toEqual(1);

     scope.$digest();
     // but now it will not be called unless the value changes
     expect(scope.counter).toEqual(1);

     scope.name = 'adam';
     scope.$digest();
     expect(scope.counter).toEqual(2);

   * Suspend watchers of this scope subtree so that they will not be invoked during digest.
   *
   * This can be used to optimize your application when you know that running those watchers
   * is redundant.
   *
   * **Warning**
   *
   * Suspending scopes from the digest cycle can have unwanted and difficult to debug results.
   * Only use this approach if you are confident that you know what you are doing and have
   * ample tests to ensure that bindings get updated as you expect.
   *
   * Some of the things to consider are:
   *
   * * Any external event on a directive/component will not trigger a digest while the hosting
   *   scope is suspended - even if the event handler calls `$apply()` or `$rootScope.$digest()`.
   * * Transcluded content exists on a scope that inherits from outside a directive but exists
   *   as a child of the directive's containing scope. If the containing scope is suspended the
   *   transcluded scope will also be suspended, even if the scope from which the transcluded
   *   scope inherits is not suspended.
   * * Multiple directives trying to manage the suspended status of a scope can confuse each other:
   *    * A call to `$suspend()` on an already suspended scope is a no-op.
   *    * A call to `$resume()` on a non-suspended scope is a no-op.
   *    * If two directives suspend a scope, then one of them resumes the scope, the scope will no
   *      longer be suspended. This could result in the other directive believing a scope to be
   *      suspended when it is not.
   * * If a parent scope is suspended then all its descendants will be also excluded from future
   *   digests whether or not they have been suspended themselves. Note that this also applies to
   *   isolate child scopes.
   * * Calling `$digest()` directly on a descendant of a suspended scope will still run the watchers
   *   for that scope and its descendants. When digesting we only check whether the current scope is
   *   locally suspended, rather than checking whether it has a suspended ancestor.
   * * Calling `$resume()` on a scope that has a suspended ancestor will not cause the scope to be
   *   included in future digests until all its ancestors have been resumed.
   * * Resolved promises, e.g. from explicit `$q` deferreds and `$http` calls, trigger `$apply()`
   *   against the `$rootScope` and so will still trigger a global digest even if the promise was
   *   initiated by a component that lives on a suspended scope.
