-
- `$sce` is a service that provides Strict Contextual Escaping services to AngularJS.
-
- ## Strict Contextual Escaping
-
- Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE) is a mode in which AngularJS constrains bindings to only render
- trusted values. Its goal is to assist in writing code in a way that (a) is secure by default, and
- (b) makes auditing for security vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking, etc. a lot easier.
-
- ### Overview
-
- To systematically block XSS security bugs, AngularJS treats all values as untrusted by default in
- HTML or sensitive URL bindings. When binding untrusted values, AngularJS will automatically
- run security checks on them (sanitizations, trusted URL resource, depending on context), or throw
- when it cannot guarantee the security of the result. That behavior depends strongly on contexts:
- HTML can be sanitized, but template URLs cannot, for instance.
-
- To illustrate this, consider the `ng-bind-html` directive. It renders its value directly as HTML:
- we call that the _context_. When given an untrusted input, AngularJS will attempt to sanitize it
- before rendering if a sanitizer is available, and throw otherwise. To bypass sanitization and
- render the input as-is, you will need to mark it as trusted for that context before attempting
- to bind it.
-
- As of version 1.2, AngularJS ships with SCE enabled by default.
-
- ### In practice
-
- Here's an example of a binding in a privileged context:
-
- ```

  ```

- <input ng-model="userHtml" aria-label="User input">
- <div ng-bind-html="userHtml"></div>
- ```

  ```

-
- Notice that `ng-bind-html` is bound to `userHtml` controlled by the user. With SCE
- disabled, this application allows the user to render arbitrary HTML into the DIV, which would
- be an XSS security bug. In a more realistic example, one may be rendering user comments, blog
- articles, etc. via bindings. (HTML is just one example of a context where rendering user
- controlled input creates security vulnerabilities.)
-
- For the case of HTML, you might use a library, either on the client side, or on the server side,
- to sanitize unsafe HTML before binding to the value and rendering it in the document.
-
- How would you ensure that every place that used these types of bindings was bound to a value that
- was sanitized by your library (or returned as safe for rendering by your server?) How can you
- ensure that you didn't accidentally delete the line that sanitized the value, or renamed some
- properties/fields and forgot to update the binding to the sanitized value?
-
- To be secure by default, AngularJS makes sure bindings go through that sanitization, or
- any similar validation process, unless there's a good reason to trust the given value in this
- context. That trust is formalized with a function call. This means that as a developer, you
- can assume all untrusted bindings are safe. Then, to audit your code for binding security issues,
- you just need to ensure the values you mark as trusted indeed are safe - because they were
- received from your server, sanitized by your library, etc. You can organize your codebase to
- help with this - perhaps allowing only the files in a specific directory to do this.
- Ensuring that the internal API exposed by that code doesn't markup arbitrary values as safe then
- becomes a more manageable task.
-
- In the case of AngularJS' SCE service, one uses {@link ng.$sce#trustAs $sce.trustAs}
- (and shorthand methods such as {@link ng.$sce#trustAsHtml $sce.trustAsHtml}, etc.) to
- build the trusted versions of your values.
-
- ### How does it work?
-
- In privileged contexts, directives and code will bind to the result of {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted
- $sce.getTrusted(context, value)} rather than to the value directly. Think of this function as
- a way to enforce the required security context in your data sink. Directives use {@link
- ng.$sce#parseAs $sce.parseAs} rather than `$parse` to watch attribute bindings, which performs
- the {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted} behind the scenes on non-constant literals. Also,
- when binding without directives, AngularJS will understand the context of your bindings
- automatically.
-
- As an example, {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} uses {@link
- ng.$sce#parseAsHtml $sce.parseAsHtml(binding expression)}. Here's the actual code (slightly
- simplified):
-
- ```

  ```

- let ngBindHtmlDirective = ['$sce', function($sce) {
- return function(scope, element, attr) {
-     scope.$watch($sce.parseAsHtml(attr.ngBindHtml), function(value) {
-       element.html(value || '');
-     });
- };
- }];
- ```

  ```

-
- ### Impact on loading templates
-
- This applies both to the {@link ng.directive:ngInclude `ng-include`} directive as well as
- `templateUrl`'s specified by {@link guide/directive directives}.
-
- By default, AngularJS only loads templates from the same domain and protocol as the application
- document. This is done by calling {@link ng.$sce#getTrustedResourceUrl
- $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl} on the template URL. To load templates from other domains and/or
- protocols, you may either add them to the {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#trustedResourceUrlList
- trustedResourceUrlList} or {@link ng.$sce#trustAsResourceUrl wrap them} into trusted values.
-
- _Please note_:
- The browser's
- [Same Origin Policy](https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_XMLHttpRequest)
- and [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)
- policy apply in addition to this and may further restrict whether the template is successfully
- loaded. This means that without the right CORS policy, loading templates from a different domain
- won't work on all browsers. Also, loading templates from `file://` URL does not work on some
- browsers.
-
- ### This feels like too much overhead
-
- It's important to remember that SCE only applies to interpolation expressions.
-
- If your expressions are constant literals, they're automatically trusted and you don't need to
- call `$sce.trustAs` on them (e.g.
- `<div ng-bind-html="'<b>implicitly trusted</b>'"></div>`) just works (remember to include the
- `ngSanitize` module). The `$sceDelegate` will also use the `$sanitize` service if it is available
- when binding untrusted values to `$sce.HTML` context.
- AngularJS provides an implementation in `angular-sanitize.js`, and if you
- wish to use it, you will also need to depend on the {@link ngSanitize `ngSanitize`} module in
- your application.
-
- The included {@link ng.$sceDelegate $sceDelegate} comes with sane defaults to allow you to load
- templates in `ng-include` from your application's domain without having to even know about SCE.
- It blocks loading templates from other domains or loading templates over http from an https
- served document. You can change these by setting your own custom {@link
- ng.$sceDelegateProvider#trustedResourceUrlList trusted resource URL list} and {@link
- ng.$sceDelegateProvider#bannedResourceUrlList banned resource URL list} for matching such URLs.
-
- This significantly reduces the overhead. It is far easier to pay the small overhead and have an
- application that's secure and can be audited to verify that with much more ease than bolting
- security onto an application later.

- ### What trusted context types are supported?
-
- | Context | Notes |
- |---------------------|----------------|
- | `$sce.HTML` | For HTML that's safe to source into the application. The {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} directive uses this context for bindings. If an unsafe value is encountered and the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize} module is present this will sanitize the value instead of throwing an error. |
- | `$sce.CSS` | For CSS that's safe to source into the application. Currently unused. Feel free to use it in your own directives. |
- | `$sce.MEDIA_URL` | For URLs that are safe to render as media. Is automatically converted from string by sanitizing when needed. |
- | `$sce.URL` | For URLs that are safe to follow as links. Is automatically converted from string by sanitizing when needed. Note that `$sce.URL` makes a stronger statement about the URL than `$sce.MEDIA_URL` does and therefore contexts requiring values trusted for `$sce.URL` can be used anywhere that values trusted for `$sce.MEDIA_URL` are required.|
- | `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` | For URLs that are not only safe to follow as links, but whose contents are also safe to include in your application. Examples include `ng-include`, `src` / `ngSrc` bindings for tags other than `IMG` (e.g. `IFRAME`, `OBJECT`, etc.) <br><br>Note that `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` makes a stronger statement about the URL than `$sce.URL` or `$sce.MEDIA_URL` do and therefore contexts requiring values trusted for `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` can be used anywhere that values trusted for `$sce.URL` or `$sce.MEDIA_URL` are required. <br><br> The {@link $sceDelegateProvider#trustedResourceUrlList $sceDelegateProvider#trustedResourceUrlList()} and {@link $sceDelegateProvider#bannedResourceUrlList $sceDelegateProvider#bannedResourceUrlList()} can be used to restrict trusted origins for `RESOURCE_URL` |
- | `$sce.JS` | For JavaScript that is safe to execute in your application's context. Currently unused. Feel free to use it in your own directives. |

- <div class="alert alert-warning">
- Be aware that, before AngularJS 1.7.0, `a[href]` and `img[src]` used to sanitize their
- interpolated values directly rather than rely upon {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted `$sce.getTrusted`}.
-
- **As of 1.7.0, this is no longer the case.**
-
- Now such interpolations are marked as requiring `$sce.URL` (for `a[href]`) or `$sce.MEDIA_URL`
- (for `img[src]`), so that the sanitization happens (via `$sce.getTrusted...`) when the `$interpolate`
- service evaluates the expressions.
- </div>
-
- There are no CSS or JS context bindings in AngularJS currently, so their corresponding `$sce.trustAs`
- functions aren't useful yet. This might evolve.
-
- ### Format of items in {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#trustedResourceUrlList trustedResourceUrlList}/{@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#bannedResourceUrlList bannedResourceUrlList} <a name="resourceUrlPatternItem"></a>
-
- Each element in these arrays must be one of the following:
-
- - **'self'**
- - The special **string**, `'self'`, can be used to match against all URLs of the \*\*same
-      domain** as the application document using the **same protocol**.
- - **String** (except the special value `'self'`)
- - The string is matched against the full _normalized / absolute URL_ of the resource
-      being tested (substring matches are not good enough.)
- - There are exactly **two wildcard sequences** - `*` and `**`. All other characters
-      match themselves.
- - `*`: matches zero or more occurrences of any character other than one of the following 6
-      characters: '`:`', '`/`', '`.`', '`?`', '`&`' and '`;`'.  It's a useful wildcard for use
-      for matching resource URL lists.
- - `**`: matches zero or more occurrences of _any_ character. As such, it's not
-      appropriate for use in a scheme, domain, etc. as it would match too much.  (e.g.
-      http://**.example.com/ would match http://evil.com/?ignore=.example.com/ and that might
-      not have been the intention.)  Its usage at the very end of the path is ok.  (e.g.
-      http://foo.example.com/templates/**).
- - **RegExp** (_see caveat below_)
- - _Caveat_: While regular expressions are powerful and offer great flexibility, their syntax
-      (and all the inevitable escaping) makes them *harder to maintain*.  It's easy to
-      accidentally introduce a bug when one updates a complex expression (imho, all regexes should
-      have good test coverage).  For instance, the use of `.` in the regex is correct only in a
-      small number of cases.  A `.` character in the regex used when matching the scheme or a
-      subdomain could be matched against a `:` or literal `.` that was likely not intended.   It
-      is highly recommended to use the string patterns and only fall back to regular expressions
-      as a last resort.
- - The regular expression must be an instance of RegExp (i.e. not a string.) It is
-      matched against the **entire** *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource being tested
-      (even when the RegExp did not have the `^` and `$` codes.)  In addition, any flags
-      present on the RegExp (such as multiline, global, ignoreCase) are ignored.
- - If you are generating your JavaScript from some other templating engine (not
-      recommended, e.g. in issue [#4006](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/4006)),
-      remember to escape your regular expression (and be aware that you might need more than
-      one level of escaping depending on your templating engine and the way you interpolated
-      the value.)  Do make use of your platform's escaping mechanism as it might be good
-      enough before coding your own.  E.g. Ruby has
-      [Regexp.escape(str)](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Regexp.html#method-c-escape)
-      and Python has [re.escape](http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.escape).
-      Javascript lacks a similar built in function for escaping.  Take a look at Google
-      Closure library's [goog.string.regExpEscape(s)](
-      http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/closure_goog_string_string.js.source.html#line962).
-
- Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} for an example.
-
-
- ## Can I disable SCE completely?
-
- Yes, you can. However, this is strongly discouraged. SCE gives you a lot of security beneits
- for little coding overhead. It will be much harder to take an SCE disabled application and
- either secure it on your own or enable SCE at a later stage. It might make sense to disable SCE
- for cases where you have a lot of existing code that was written before SCE was introduced and
- you're migrating them a module at a time. Also do note that this is an app-wide setting, so if
- you are writing a library, you will cause security bugs applications using it.
-
- That said, here's how you can completely disable SCE:
-
- ```

  ```

- angular.module('myAppWithSceDisabledmyApp', []).config(function($sceProvider) {
- // Completely disable SCE. For demonstration purposes only!
- // Do not use in new projects or libraries.
- $sceProvider.enabled(false);
- });
- ```

  ```

/\* Design notes on the default implementation for SCE.

-
- The API contract for the SCE delegate
- ***
- The SCE delegate object must provide the following 3 methods:
-
- - trustAs(contextEnum, value)
-     This method is used to tell the SCE service that the provided value is OK to use in the
-     contexts specified by contextEnum.  It must return an object that will be accepted by
-     getTrusted() for a compatible contextEnum and return this value.
-
- - valueOf(value)
-     For values that were not produced by trustAs(), return them as is.  For values that were
-     produced by trustAs(), return the corresponding input value to trustAs.  Basically, if
-     trustAs is wrapping the given values into some type, this operation unwraps it when given
-     such a value.
-
- - getTrusted(contextEnum, value)
-     This function should return the value that is safe to use in the context specified by
-     contextEnum or throw and exception otherwise.
-
- NOTE: This contract deliberately does NOT state that values returned by trustAs() must be
- opaque or wrapped in some holder object. That happens to be an implementation detail. For
- instance, an implementation could maintain a registry of all trusted objects by context. In
- such a case, trustAs() would return the same object that was passed in. getTrusted() would
- return the same object passed in if it was found in the registry under a compatible context or
- throw an exception otherwise. An implementation might only wrap values some of the time based
- on some criteria. getTrusted() might return a value and not throw an exception for special
- constants or objects even if not wrapped. All such implementations fulfill this contract.
-
-
- A note on the inheritance model for SCE contexts
- ***
- I've used inheritance and made RESOURCE_URL wrapped types a subtype of URL wrapped types. This
- is purely an implementation details.
-
- The contract is simply this:
-
-     getTrusted($sce.RESOURCE_URL, value) succeeding implies that getTrusted($sce.URL, value)
-     will also succeed.
-
- Inheritance happens to capture this in a natural way. In some future, we may not use
- inheritance anymore. That is OK because no code outside of sce.js and sceSpecs.js would need to
- be aware of this detail.
