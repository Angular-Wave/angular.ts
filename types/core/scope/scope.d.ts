 * DESIGN NOTES
 *
 * The design decisions behind the scope are heavily favored for speed and memory consumption.
 *
 * The typical use of scope is to watch the expressions, which most of the time return the same
 * value as last time so we optimize the operation.
 *
 * Closures construction is expensive in terms of speed as well as memory:
 *   - No closures, instead use prototypical inheritance for API
 *   - Internal state needs to be stored on scope directly, which means that private state is
 *     exposed as $$____ properties
 *
 * Loop operations are optimized by using while(count--) { ... }
 *   - This means that in order to keep the same order of execution as addition we have to add
 *     items to the array at the beginning (unshift) instead of at the end (push)
 *
 * Child scopes are created and removed often
 *   - Using an array would be slow since inserts in the middle are expensive; so we use linked lists
 *
 * There are fewer watches than observers. This is why you don't want the observer to be implemented
 * in the same way as watch. Watch requires return of the initialization function which is expensive
 * to construct.

   * Registers a `listener` callback to be executed whenever the `watchExpression` changes.
   *
   * - The `watchExpression` is called on every call to {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest
   *   $digest()} and should return the value that will be watched. (`watchExpression` should not change
   *   its value when executed multiple times with the same input because it may be executed multiple
   *   times by {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest()}. That is, `watchExpression` should be
   *   [idempotent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence).)
   * - The `listener` is called only when the value from the current `watchExpression` and the
   *   previous call to `watchExpression` are not equal (with the exception of the initial run,
   *   see below). Inequality is determined according to reference inequality,
   *   [strict comparison](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators)
   *    via the `!==` Javascript operator, unless `objectEquality == true`
   *   (see next point)
   * - When `objectEquality == true`, inequality of the `watchExpression` is determined
   *   according to the {@link angular.equals} function. To save the value of the object for
   *   later comparison, the {@link structuredClone} function is used. This therefore means that
   *   watching complex objects will have adverse memory and performance implications.
   * - This should not be used to watch for changes in objects that are (or contain)
   *   [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/File) objects due to limitations with {@link structuredClone `structuredClone`}.
   * - The watch `listener` may change the model, which may trigger other `listener`s to fire.
   *   This is achieved by rerunning the watchers until no changes are detected. The rerun
   *   iteration limit is 10 to prevent an infinite loop deadlock.
   *
   *
   * If you want to be notified whenever {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} is called,
   * you can register a `watchExpression` function with no `listener`. (Be prepared for
   * multiple calls to your `watchExpression` because it will execute multiple times in a
   * single {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} cycle if a change is detected.)
   *
   * After a watcher is registered with the scope, the `listener` fn is called asynchronously
   * (via {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$evalAsync $evalAsync}) to initialize the
   * watcher. In rare cases, this is undesirable because the listener is called when the result
   * of `watchExpression` didn't change. To detect this scenario within the `listener` fn, you
   * can compare the `newVal` and `oldVal`. If these two values are identical (`===`) then the
   * listener was called due to initialization.
   *
   *
   *
   * @example
   * ```js
       // let's assume that scope was dependency injected as the $rootScope
       let scope = $rootScope;
       scope.name = 'misko';
       scope.counter = 0;

       });
       expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);
  
       scope.$digest();

       expect(scope.counter).toEqual(1);
  
       scope.$digest();
       // but now it will not be called unless the value changes
       expect(scope.counter).toEqual(1);

         function() { return food; },

     *   transcluded scope will also be suspended, even if the scope from which the transcluded
     *   scope inherits is not suspended.
     * * Multiple directives trying to manage the suspended status of a scope can confuse each other:
     *    * A call to `$suspend()` on an already suspended scope is a no-op.
     *    * A call to `$resume()` on a non-suspended scope is a no-op.
     *    * If two directives suspend a scope, then one of them resumes the scope, the scope will no
     *      longer be suspended. This could result in the other directive believing a scope to be
     *      suspended when it is not.
     * * If a parent scope is suspended then all its descendants will be also excluded from future
     *   digests whether or not they have been suspended themselves. Note that this also applies to
     *   isolate child scopes.
     * * Calling `$digest()` directly on a descendant of a suspended scope will still run the watchers
     *   for that scope and its descendants. When digesting we only check whether the current scope is
     *   locally suspended, rather than checking whether it has a suspended ancestor.
     * * Calling `$resume()` on a scope that has a suspended ancestor will not cause the scope to be
     *   included in future digests until all its ancestors have been resumed.
     * * Resolved promises, e.g. from explicit `$q` deferreds and `$http` calls, trigger `$apply()`
     *   against the `$rootScope` and so will still trigger a global digest even if the promise was

     *     `expression` execution.
     *
     * Any exceptions from the execution of the expression are forwarded to the
     * {@link ng.$exceptionHandler $exceptionHandler} service.
     *
     * __Note:__ if this function is called outside of a `$digest` cycle, a new `$digest` cycle
     * will be scheduled. However, it is encouraged to always call code that changes the model
     * from within an `$apply` call. That includes code evaluated via `$evalAsync`.

     * discussion of event life cycle.
     *
     * The event listener function format is: `function(event, args...)`. The `event` object
     * passed into the listener has the following attributes:
     *
     *   - `targetScope` - `{Scope}`: the scope on which the event was `$emit`-ed or
     *     `$broadcast`-ed.
     *   - `currentScope` - `{Scope}`: the scope that is currently handling the event. Once the
     *     event propagates through the scope hierarchy, this property is set to null.
     *   - `name` - `{string}`: name of the event.
     *   - `stopPropagation` - `{function=}`: calling `stopPropagation` function will cancel
     *     further event propagation (available only for events that were `$emit`-ed).
     *   - `preventDefault` - `{function}`: calling `preventDefault` sets `defaultPrevented` flag
     *     to true.
     *   - `defaultPrevented` - `{boolean}`: true if `preventDefault` was called.
     *
     * @param {string} name Event name to listen on.
     * @param {function(any): any} listener Function to call when the event is emitted witn angular.IAngularEvent
     * @returns {function()} Returns a deregistration function for this listener.
