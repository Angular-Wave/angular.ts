     *    - `controllerAs` – `{string=}` – identifier name for to reference the controller in the component's scope.
     *      If present, the controller will be published to scope under the `controllerAs` name.
     *      If not present, this will default to be `$ctrl`.

     *
     *      - `$element` - Current element
     *      - `$attrs` - Current attributes object for the element
     *
     *    - `templateUrl` – `{string=|function()=}` – path or function that returns a path to an html

     *      - `$attrs` - Current attributes object for the element

     *    - `bindings` – `{object=}` – defines bindings between DOM attributes and component properties.
     *      Component properties are always bound to the component controller and not to the scope.
     *      See {`bindToController`}.
     *    - `transclude` – `{boolean=}` – whether {content transclusion} is enabled.
     *      Disabled by default.
     *    - `require` - `{Object<string, string>=}` - requires the controllers of other directives and binds them to
     *      this component's controller. The object keys specify the property names under which the required
     *      controllers (object values) will be bound. See {`require`}.

     *      constructor function. (This is used by the component router to annotate)
