     * parsed into another type, such as a `Date` object for `input[date]`.)
     * However, custom controls might also pass objects to this method. In this case, we should make
     * a copy of the object before passing it to `$setViewValue`. This is because `ngModel` does not
     * perform a deep watch of objects, it only looks for a change of identity. If you only change

     * The widget can then call `ctrl.$processModelValue()` to run the model -> view
