 * </div>
 *
 * Typically, you would configure or override the {@link ng.$sceDelegate $sceDelegate} instead of
 * the `$sce` service to customize the way Strict Contextual Escaping works in AngularTS.  This is
 * because, while the `$sce` provides numerous shorthand methods, etc., you really only need to
 * override 3 core functions (`trustAs`, `getTrusted` and `valueOf`) to replace the way things
 * work because `$sce` delegates to `$sceDelegate` for these operations.
 *
 * Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} to configure this service.

 * The default instance of `$sceDelegate` should work out of the box with little pain.  While you

 *
 * The `$sceDelegateProvider` allows one to get/set the `trustedResourceUrlList` and
 * `bannedResourceUrlList` used to ensure that the URLs used for sourcing AngularTS templates and
 * other script-running URLs are safe (all places that use the `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` context). See
 * {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#trustedResourceUrlList

 *
 * For the general details about this service in AngularTS, read the main page for {@link ng.$sce
 * Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE)}.
 *
 * **Example**:  Consider the following case. <a name="example"></a>
 *
 * - your app is hosted at url `http://myapp.example.com/`
 * - but some of your templates are hosted on other domains you control such as
 *   `http://srv01.assets.example.com/`, `http://srv02.assets.example.com/`, etc.
 * - and you have an open redirect at `http://myapp.example.com/clickThru?...`.
 *
 * Here is what a secure configuration for this scenario might look like:
 *
 * ```
 *  angular.module('myApp', []).config(function($sceDelegateProvider) {
 *    $sceDelegateProvider.trustedResourceUrlList([
 *      // Allow same origin resource loads.
 *      'self',
 *      // Allow loading from our assets domain.  Notice the difference between * and **.
 *      'http://srv*.assets.example.com/**'
 *    ]);
 *
 *    // The banned resource URL list overrides the trusted resource URL list so the open redirect
 *    // here is blocked.
 *    $sceDelegateProvider.bannedResourceUrlList([
 *      'http://myapp.example.com/clickThru**'
 *    ]);
 *  });
 * ```
 * Note that an empty trusted resource URL list will block every resource URL from being loaded, and will require
 * you to manually mark each one as trusted with `$sce.trustAsResourceUrl`. However, templates
 * requested by {@link ng.$templateRequest $templateRequest} that are present in
 * {@link ng.$templateCache $templateCache} will not go through this check. If you have a mechanism
 * to populate your templates in that cache at config time, then it is a good idea to remove 'self'
 * from the trusted resource URL lsit. This helps to mitigate the security impact of certain types
 * of issues, like for instance attacker-controlled `ng-includes`.
