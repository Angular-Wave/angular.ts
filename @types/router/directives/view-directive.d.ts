/**
 * `ng-view`: A viewport directive which is filled in by a view from the active state.
 *
 * ### Attributes
 *
 * - `name`: (Optional) A view name.
 *   The name should be unique amongst the other views in the same state.
 *   You can have views of the same name that live in different states.
 *   The ng-view can be targeted in a View using the name ([[Ng1StateDeclaration.views]]).
 *
 * - `autoscroll`: an expression. When it evaluates to true, the `ng-view` will be scrolled into view when it is activated.
 *   Uses [[$ngViewScroll]] to do the scrolling.
 *
 * - `onload`: Expression to evaluate whenever the view updates.
 *
 * #### Example:
 * A view can be unnamed or named.
 * ```html
 * <!-- Unnamed -->
 * <div ng-view></div>
 *
 * <!-- Named -->
 * <div ng-view="viewName"></div>
 *
 * <!-- Named (different style) -->
 * <ng-view name="viewName"></ng-view>
 * ```
 *
 * You can only have one unnamed view within any template (or root html). If you are only using a
 * single view and it is unnamed then you can populate it like so:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-view></div>
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * The above is a convenient shortcut equivalent to specifying your view explicitly with the
 * [[Ng1StateDeclaration.views]] config property, by name, in this case an empty name:
 *
 * ```js
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   views: {
 *     "": {
 *       template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 *     }
 *   }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * But typically you'll only use the views property if you name your view or have more than one view
 * in the same template. There's not really a compelling reason to name a view if its the only one,
 * but you could if you wanted, like so:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-view="main"></div>
 * ```
 *
 * ```js
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   views: {
 *     "main": {
 *       template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 *     }
 *   }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * Really though, you'll use views to set up multiple views:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-view></div>
 * <div ng-view="chart"></div>
 * <div ng-view="data"></div>
 * ```
 *
 * ```js
 * $stateProvider.state("home", {
 *   views: {
 *     "": {
 *       template: "<h1>HELLO!</h1>"
 *     },
 *     "chart": {
 *       template: "<chart_thing/>"
 *     },
 *     "data": {
 *       template: "<data_thing/>"
 *     }
 *   }
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * #### Examples for `autoscroll`:
 * ```html
 * <!-- If autoscroll present with no expression,
 *      then scroll ng-view into view -->
 * <ng-view autoscroll/>
 *
 * <!-- If autoscroll present with valid expression,
 *      then scroll ng-view into view if expression evaluates to true -->
 * <ng-view autoscroll='true'/>
 * <ng-view autoscroll='false'/>
 * <ng-view autoscroll='scopeVariable'/>
 * ```
 *
 * Resolve data:
 *
 * The resolved data from the state's `resolve` block is placed on the scope as `$resolve` (this
 * can be customized using [[Ng1ViewDeclaration.resolveAs]]).  This can be then accessed from the template.
 *
 * Note that when `controllerAs` is being used, `$resolve` is set on the controller instance *after* the
 * controller is instantiated.  The `$onInit()` hook can be used to perform initialization code which
 * depends on `$resolve` data.
 *
 * #### Example:
 * ```js
 * $stateProvider.state('home', {
 *   template: '<my-component user="$resolve.user"></my-component>',
 *   resolve: {
 *     user: function(UserService) { return UserService.fetchUser(); }
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
