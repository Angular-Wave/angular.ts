    /**
     * Creates a [[UIInjector]] Dependency Injector
     *
     * Returns a Dependency Injector for the Transition's target state (to state).
     * The injector provides resolve values which the target state has access to.
     *
     * The `UIInjector` can also provide values from the native root/global injector (ng1/ng2).
     *
     * #### Example:
     * ```js
     * .onEnter({ entering: 'myState' }, trans => {
     *   var myResolveValue = trans.injector().get('myResolve');
     *   // Inject a global service from the global/native injector (if it exists)
     *   var MyService = trans.injector().get('MyService');
     * })
     * ```
     *
     * In some cases (such as `onBefore`), you may need access to some resolve data but it has not yet been fetched.
     * You can use [[UIInjector.getAsync]] to get a promise for the data.
     * #### Example:
     * ```js
     * .onBefore({}, trans => {
     *   return trans.injector().getAsync('myResolve').then(myResolveValue =>
     *     return myResolveValue !== 'ABORT';
     *   });
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * If a `state` is provided, the injector that is returned will be limited to resolve values that the provided state has access to.
     * This can be useful if both a parent state `foo` and a child state `foo.bar` have both defined a resolve such as `data`.
     * #### Example:
     * ```js
     * .onEnter({ to: 'foo.bar' }, trans => {
     *   // returns result of `foo` state's `myResolve` resolve
     *   // even though `foo.bar` also has a `myResolve` resolve
     *   var fooData = trans.injector('foo').get('myResolve');
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * If you need resolve data from the exiting states, pass `'from'` as `pathName`.
     * The resolve data from the `from` path will be returned.
     * #### Example:
     * ```js
     * .onExit({ exiting: 'foo.bar' }, trans => {
     *   // Gets the resolve value of `myResolve` from the state being exited
     *   var fooData = trans.injector(null, 'from').get('myResolve');
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * @param state Limits the resolves provided to only the resolves the provided state has access to.
     * @param pathName Default: `'to'`: Chooses the path for which to create the injector. Use this to access resolves for `exiting` states.
     *
     * @returns a [[UIInjector]]

     * This returns all the tokens defined on [[StateDeclaration.resolve]] blocks, for the states
     * in the Transition's [[TreeChanges.to]] path.

     * #### Example:
     * This example logs all resolve values

     * let tokens = trans.getResolveTokens();
     * tokens.forEach(token => console.log(token + " = " + trans.injector().get(token)));
     * ```

     * This triggers fetches of resolves (if any have not yet been fetched).
     * When all promises have all settled, it logs the resolve values.
     * ```js

     * let promise = tokens.map(token => trans.injector().getAsync(token));
