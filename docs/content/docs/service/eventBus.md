### Description

A messaging service, backed by an instance of [PubSub](../../../typedoc/classes/PubSub.html). This implementation is based on the original
[Google Closure PubSub](https://google.github.io/closure-library/api/goog.pubsub.PubSub.html) but uses 
[`Promise.resolve()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/resolve) 
instead of [`Window.setTimeout()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setTimeout) for its async implementation.
`$eventBus` allows communication between an Angular application instance and the outside context, which can be a different module, 
a non-Angular application, a third-party party library, or even a WASM application. Additionally, `$eventBus` can be used to communicate directly with a template, 
using [`ng-channel`](../../../docs/directive/channel) directive.

`$eventBus` should not be used for communicating between Angular's own primitives. 

- **For sharing application state**: use custom Services and Factories that encapsulate your business logic and manage your model. 
- **For intercomponent communication**: use `$scope.$on()`, `$scope.$emit()`, and `$scope.$broadcast()` methods. 

The example below demonstrates communication between the global `window` context and a controller.
**Note**: Ensure topic clean-up after the `$scope` is destroyed
