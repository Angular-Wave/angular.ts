Welcome to AngularTS documentation. 

This section is a work in progress. Its content will be updated regularly but feel free to rely on [AngularJS](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide) 
documentation in the meantime.

### What is AngularTS?

AngularTS is buildless, typesafe and reactive JS framework for building stuctured web-applications at any scale. It continues the legacy
of [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) by providing the best developer-experience and immediate productivity without 
the burden of JS ecosystem tooling. Getting started with AngularTS does not even require Javascript.

Below is a canonical counter:

#### Example 
{{< showcode src="examples/counter.html" >}}

#### Result 
<div ng-app> 
    <div ng-include="'/angular.ts/examples/counter.html'"></div>
</div>
